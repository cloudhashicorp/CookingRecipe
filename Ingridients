Planning and Preparation:

Collaborate with the application support team to identify the specific requirements and dependencies for the upgrade. This includes understanding the new version's features, any compatibility issues, and potential impacts on the current infrastructure.
Engage with the cc to evaluate the readiness of the existing EC2 instances and AWS RDS MSSQL databases for the upgrade. This involves assessing resource utilization, performance metrics, and any required configuration changes.
Work closely with the operations team to ensure alignment with their processes and requirements for the cutover, including maintenance windows, change management procedures, and rollback plans.
Environment Setup:

Provision new EC2 instances with the updated application version, ensuring that the instances meet the necessary hardware and software requirements.
Create a new AWS RDS MSSQL instance for the new version, perform a data migration from the existing database, and validate its integrity.
Configure appropriate security groups, networking settings, and access controls to ensure proper communication between the upgraded application components and other dependencies.
Testing and Validation:

Collaborate with the application support team to conduct thorough testing of the upgraded application version on the new infrastructure. This includes functional, integration, and performance testing to identify and address any issues.
Engage the operations team to perform acceptance testing and validate that the necessary monitoring, logging, and alerting mechanisms are in place for the upgraded application.
Data Synchronization and Cutover:

Establish a plan with the application support and operations teams to synchronize the data between the old and new versions during the cutover window to ensure data consistency.
Minimize downtime by carefully orchestrating the cutover process, which may involve tasks such as switching load balancer configurations, updating DNS records, and rerouting traffic to the new infrastructure gradually.
Monitor the cutover process closely and have rollback procedures in place to address any unforeseen issues or disruptions that may arise.
Post-Cutover Activities:

Collaborate with the application support team to perform thorough post-cutover testing and validation, ensuring that the upgraded application is functioning as expected and any data synchronization is successful.
Engage with the operations team to monitor the application's performance, conduct post-cutover performance tuning if necessary, and address any remaining issues.
Document the entire cutover process, including the steps performed, configurations made, and lessons learned for future reference.
Throughout the cutover process, effective communication and coordination among the application support, cloud managed services, and operations teams are essential to ensure a seamless and successful upgrade to the new application version. Regular checkpoints, collaboration sessions, and post-cutover reviews should be conducted to address any challenges and refine the process for future upgrades.
