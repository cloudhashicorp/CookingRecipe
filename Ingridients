Backup of Files:
a. Identify and implement a backup solution to regularly create and store backups of critical files, databases, and configurations in a secure location.
b. Validate the successful completion of backup jobs and verify the integrity of the backup data to ensure it can be used for recovery purposes.

Spin Up New File Server Instance in ASG:
a. Utilize the Auto Scaling Group (ASG) to launch a new instance of the file server in a different availability zone (AZ) from the production environment.
b. Verify the successful launch and availability of the new file server instance, including the proper configuration settings, software, and security groups.

Verify Application Server Configuration:
a. Validate the configuration of the application servers in the disaster recovery environment, including the operating system, software versions, security settings, and any other relevant configurations.
b. Ensure that the application servers are properly set up to function in the failover environment and can communicate with other required services.

Verify No Files Present in Archive Directory:
a. Validate that the archive directory of the file server in the disaster recovery environment does not contain any files or data that could conflict with the production environment.
b. Ensure that the archive directory is properly configured and empty to avoid any data integrity issues during the recovery process.

RDS Instance Verification:
a. Verify the status and health of the RDS instance in the disaster recovery environment, especially if it is a multi-AZ configuration.
b. Confirm that the RDS instance is running, properly configured, and accessible, and that it can be used for data recovery purposes.

Restore Failed Availability Zone:
a. Simulate a failed availability zone in the production environment, either by manually stopping instances or using AWS services to trigger a failure.
b. Follow the documented procedures to initiate the failover process and restore the production services in the disaster recovery environment, including spinning up new instances, updating load balancers, and DNS settings.

Stopping Application Services:
a. Gracefully stop the application services running on the affected application servers in the failed availability zone.
b. Validate that the application services are properly stopped, and no residual processes are running to avoid conflicts during the recovery process.

ASG to Create New Application Server in New AZ:
a. Use the ASG to create a new instance of the application server in the unaffected availability zone to replace the failed instance.
b. Verify the successful launch and configuration of the new application server instance, including the proper settings, software, and security groups.

Health Check of Application and Control-M Jobs:
a. Perform thorough health checks of the application servers, including validating the proper functioning of the application services, databases, and other dependencies.
b. Also, validate the proper functioning of any Control-M jobs or other scheduled tasks that are critical for the application's operation.

Simulate Failed Availability Zone:
a. Simulate the failure of an availability zone in the disaster recovery environment, either by manually stopping instances or using AWS services to trigger a failure.
b. Follow the documented procedures to initiate the recovery process, including spinning up new instances, updating load balancers, and DNS settings, and validating the successful failover and recovery of the application services.

Post-Disaster Recovery Verification:
a. Verify the environment setup of the file server after spinning up a new instance, including the proper configuration settings, data integrity, and accessibility of the files.
b. Perform thorough business verification after recovery, including testing critical business processes, validating data integrity, and ensuring that the application is meeting the business requirements.

Business Verification After Recovery:
a. Coordinate with the business stakeholders to validate the functionality and performance of the application from a business perspective.
b. Perform thorough testing
